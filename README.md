# Alexandria Core

This library contains Alexandria's core functions like kernel configuration, exceptions, query-parameters utilities, validators, etc...

This was made specifically for Go.

**IMPORTANT: Currently migrating to common-go and many more independent packages to avoid unused dependencies**
